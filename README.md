- Navlinks include links to this project's Github repo, my LinkedIn and personal Website, and the About modal.<br>

- Controls will include Pause, and Reset buttons, as well as which keys to use to control the Player.<br>

- On top right, there will be a Pause, Play, Mute, and Next button for the music in the game. Also want to add a slider for music volume<br>

- On the top left, there will be an image of the Watering Man character's face and it will show how many hits are remaining. You can start with 3 hears for Normal mode and 1 for Hard mode. Each time you get hit, one heart will be visably removed.<br>
